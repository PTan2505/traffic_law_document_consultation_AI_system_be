# RAG System Improvements for Vietnamese Traffic Law Chatbot

## Problem Statement

The original issue was that when asking "Vượt đèn đỏ bị phạt bao nhiêu?" (How much is the penalty for running a red light?), the chatbot was matching "vượt xe" (overtaking) instead of understanding the semantic meaning of "vượt đèn đỏ" (running a red light), which should match "không chấp hành hiệu lệnh của đèn tín hiệu giao thông" (not obeying traffic light signals).

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Semantic Understanding

- **Semantic Keyword Mapping**: Added mapping between user terms and legal document terms
  - "vượt đèn đỏ" → "không chấp hành hiệu lệnh của đèn tín hiệu giao thông"
  - "vượt xe" → "vượt xe", "vượt ẩu", "vượt không đúng quy định"
  - "say rượu" → "điều khiển phương tiện trong tình trạng say rượu"
  - And many more semantic mappings

### 2. Improved Chunk Scoring System

- **Context-Aware Scoring**:
  - High boost (+15 points) for semantic matches
  - Penalty reduction (-10 points) for wrong context matches
  - Priority scoring (+25 points) for exact article references
- **Disambiguation Logic**:
  - When user asks about "vượt đèn đỏ", prioritize chunks with "đèn tín hiệu"
  - Penalize chunks that only mention "vượt xe" without traffic light context

### 3. Document Inconsistency Detection

- **Penalty Amount Handling**: Detects when multiple documents have different penalty amounts
- **Document Recency**: Prioritizes more recent regulations (higher decree numbers, recent years)
- **Comprehensive Content**: Favors documents with more detailed penalty structures
- **Specific Article Priority**: When user mentions specific articles, those take precedence

### 4. Enhanced System Instructions

- **Semantic Understanding**: Explicitly tells the AI that "vượt đèn đỏ" means "không chấp hành hiệu lệnh của đèn tín hiệu giao thông"
- **Penalty Amount Guidelines**: Instructions for handling conflicting penalty amounts
- **Vehicle Type Specificity**: Guidance on providing vehicle-specific penalty amounts
- **Citation Requirements**: Always cite specific articles and regulations

### 5. RAG vs Full Document Logic

- **Legal/Penalty Queries**: Use full document content for comprehensive answers
- **General Queries**: Use RAG chunks for efficiency
- **Fallback System**: If RAG doesn't find relevant chunks, fall back to full documents
- **Cache Management**: Automatic cache refresh when documents are updated

## Technical Implementation Details

### New Methods Added:

1. `extractLegalKeywords()` - Enhanced semantic keyword extraction
2. `scoreChunkRelevance()` - Improved chunk scoring with context awareness
3. `detectPenaltyInconsistencies()` - Handles document inconsistencies
4. `isLegalPenaltyQuery()` - Detects queries needing comprehensive answers
5. `refreshCache()` - Public method for cache management

### Test Cases Added:

- Red light violation semantic understanding
- Specific article reference prioritization
- Overtaking vs red light disambiguation
- General query RAG mode
- Greeting detection
- English query handling

## Expected Results

### Before Improvements:

- "Vượt đèn đỏ" might match "vượt xe" content incorrectly
- Inconsistent penalty amounts from different documents
- No semantic understanding of Vietnamese legal terminology

### After Improvements:

- "Vượt đèn đỏ" correctly matches traffic light violation content
- Prioritizes most recent/specific penalty amounts
- Understands semantic meaning of Vietnamese traffic law terms
- Provides accurate, comprehensive, and consistent answers
- Handles both general and specific legal queries appropriately

## Usage Instructions

1. **Test the Improvements**: Use the test buttons in the HTML client:

   - 📚 Penalty Query (Full Docs): Tests comprehensive legal answers
   - 🔍 General Query (RAG): Tests efficient chunk retrieval
   - 👋 Greeting Test: Tests greeting detection
   - 🇬🇧 English Query: Tests language detection

2. **Specific Test Cases**:

   - "Vượt đèn đỏ bị phạt bao nhiêu?" - Should find traffic light violations
   - "Vượt xe bị phạt bao nhiêu?" - Should find overtaking violations
   - "Điểm b Khoản 9 Điều 6" - Should prioritize specific article

3. **Monitor Console Logs**: The system provides detailed logging for debugging:
   - Chunk selection process
   - Scoring explanations
   - Cache refresh notifications
   - RAG vs full document decisions

## Performance Benefits

- **Reduced Prompt Size**: RAG chunking reduces prompt length for general queries
- **Improved Accuracy**: Semantic understanding provides more relevant answers
- **Better Consistency**: Document inconsistency detection ensures accurate penalty amounts
- **Enhanced User Experience**: No unnecessary greetings, direct answers to questions

The improvements ensure that the chatbot now understands the actual meaning of Vietnamese traffic law questions and provides accurate, relevant, and comprehensive answers while optimizing for both performance and accuracy.
